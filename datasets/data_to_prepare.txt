A teenager is watching a porn


PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded
shirts...pants...socks...and hear

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
          Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you're so
good.

JIM (O.S.)
          Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear. Or, more
appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in and
out. Bars scroll across it. And we get occasional glimpses
of what looks like --


Protagonist gets excited over a porn movie


He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off the
floor.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
          You're so big!

JIM
          Yeah, that's right.


The protagonist tries to hide the porn he's watching


JIM
          Yeah. Damn cable. There's this
          nature show that I'm trying to
          watch.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
          Fuck me!  Yes!

JIM 
Uh...

He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,
but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
          BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!

Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.


Jim's dad enters the room


JIM
              (choking)
          Must...be...broken...

JIM'S DAD enters.

JIM'S DAD
          What the heck is this?

JIM 
Nothing!

JIM'S MOM
          I think he's trying to watch one of
          the illegal channels.

JIM
          Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal!
          They're pay channels. How could a
          television channel be illegal?!
          God, get a clue!


Dad finds out what his son is doing


JIM'S MOM
          Oh my God!

JIM'S DAD
          Honey, why don't you let me handle
this one.

He ushers her out. Jim's Dad is stuck there with his half-
naked son. Horrible, awful embarrassment. A long, strained
beat.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ. The dictionary?
          Hell, son, I'll buy you some dirty
          magazines.


We meet Oz


Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky
senior with a football-player build. He cradles a ball in a
lacrosse stick.

OZ
          Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's
          any channel that should be illegal,
          it's whatever that women's channel
          is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose,
          or some shit.


Jim finds the little mermaid hot


JIM
          Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little
          Mermaid on TV the other night?
          That Ariel, whew.

OZ
          She's a mermaid, dude.

JIM
              (trumping him)
          Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on
          land.

OZ
          She's a cartoon, dude.

JIM
          A hot cartoon.


Kevin maybe has a girlfriend


Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall. Oz
bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it again.
Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

KEVIN
          Then she said -- she loves me.

OZ
          Oh shit dude, the L-word!

JIM
          And you said...

KEVIN
          Nothing, I just hugged her back.

JIM
          You think she was serious?

KEVIN
          I couldn't tell -- She could've
          meant like, "I love you grandma" or
          "I love you Vanderbilt."


The group of Band Dorks try to play their instruments backward


The guys pass by a GROUP OF BAND DORKS, most notable of
which is MICHELLE, who proudly polishes her flute.

MICHELLE
          And what we should do today, in
          band? Instead of playing our
          instruments regularly?  We should
          play them backwards!  That'll be so
          funny!

The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting to
play their instruments from the wrong end. The guys shudder.


We meet Stifler


KEVIN
          Whatever.

Someone is HOLLERING down the hall. Running towards Oz is
STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a maniac, a
jackass, much worse than Oz. Not really part of the group.
NOVA!!

STIFLER
    (yelling)
OZ Stifler!!


Kevin's brother tells Kevin about the bible


KEVIN
          Yeah, well anyway...I thought you
          might have some advice, brother to
          brother. I mean, I think tonight
          she might, we might really, there's
          a chance that -- you know.

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          Have you ever heard of the bible?

KEVIN
          What?  Not the Bible?

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          Well, that's not really the name,
          but we always called it that.

KEVIN
          Does it tell me how to get laid?

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          You know what, nevermind. You're
not ready.


Kevin arrives at the party


A small, nostalgia-themed dive. Despite the theme, CLASSIC
ROCK plays. Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch sit at a table. They
munch on hot dogs piled high with condiments.

KEVIN
          You ever hear of something called
The Bible?

OZ
          Once, in church, dude.


Protagonists talk about Finch's hotdog


FINCH
          Perhaps you should consider
          actually answering an ad.

JIM
          Finch, you can be the one to date a
          nearly-dead insane chick. Eat your
          damn imitation hot dog.

FINCH
              ("for the hundredth
               time")
          This is no imitation. Removing the
          hot dog from the Ultradog yields a
          better dog. Behold -- Ultradog, no
          dog.

Finch displays the cross-section on his hot dog. It's all
condiments. The guys react with rehearsed offense.


Jim asks which haircut is better on him


JIM
          So, does my hair look better --
              (flips a small lock of
               hair onto his forehead)
          like this, or...
              (flips it back up)
like this?

OZ 
Who cares?

JIM
          Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian
          chick, she might be there tonight.
          Now, do you think she'd prefer --
              (flips hair down again)
          Cool Hip Jim...
              (flips it back up)
          or Laid Back Jim?

KEVIN
          The difference is so phenomenal, I
          can't decide.


The protagonists talk about the third base


JIM
          So let's say you get there...what's
          uh, third base feel like?

KEVIN
          Oh, man, that's kind of sad.

Jim shrugs, embarrassed.

OZ
          Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

JIM
          Apple pie...
              (then)
          McDonald's or homemade?


There's a party in Stifler's house


For a high-school party, it's pretty good. The house is
peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS. MUSIC
blends with the din of excited conversation.
Kevin and Jim are drinking beers. Around them, students
mingle and flirt. CHUCK SHERMAN comes up.


We meet Sherman


SHERMAN
          What's up, fellas?

JIM
          Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.

SHERMAN
          Indeed. Some fine ladies here,
          boys. Confidence is high, repeat,
          confidence is high.

Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.


Jim likes Nadia


Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys,
EXCHANGING GREETINGS. Jim spots NADIA across the room. She's
beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman.

JIM
          Oh, shit!  There she is. Nadia.

VICKY
          You like her?  Her sponsor family
          lives on my block. Why don't you
          talk to her?

JIM
          What would I say?

VICKY
          Just tell her what's on your mind.
          And smile, you've got a good smile.
              (then to Kevin)
Come on.


Jim talks to Nadia


JIM (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          Kevin, get back here!
But he's gone. And Nadia is now in front of him. With no
other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big.

NADIA
              (with a really sexy
               accent)
          You are in my English class, no?

Jim smiles.

JIM 
(barely)
Yes.

NADIA
          I thought so.


Nadia goes away


She walks off. Jim SIGHS, completely relaxing, like a huge
burden is now off of him. He wipes his brow. Then, realizing
--

JIM
          Oh, shit. No!  Shit!

He pounds his head with his fist.


The Band Dorks arrive to the party


A group of band dorks is on the porch, including Michelle.
Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them in disbelief.

MICHELLE
          We're here for the party?

STIFLER
          What party?  There's no party.

MUSIC blares from inside. A drunken HAND reaches through the
door and ruffles Stifler's hair.


Kevin and Vicky are making out in a bed


Kevin and Vicky are on the bed, making out.

VICKY
          Oh, Kev.

KEVIN
          Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's
          time for us to take the next step
          in our relationship?


A girl laughs to Oz after he asks her to suck him


OZ
              (not so confidently)
          Suck me...beautiful?

The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief. She tries to
keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter.

COLLEGE CHICK
What?!

Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just had
the rug pulled from under him.

OZ
          Uh...you know, my friends call me
          Nova -- as in Casanova.

COLLEGE CHICK
          You need some work, buddy!


College Chick accompanies Oz to his friends after his fail


She's trying not to laugh again.

COLLEGE CHICK
          Come on, I'll drop you off at your
          friends'.

Oz couldn't be humiliated any further. 


Stifler laughs at Oz for his fail


Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim,
Stifler, and some guys.

STIFLER
              (hysterical, toppling
               over)
          You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!

OZ
          Shut the fuck up.
 
JIM
          Hey, you did better than I did,
Nova.

OZ
          Oh that's really reassuring. And
          don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a
          fraud.

STIFLER
          This is pathetic. I'm gonna find me
          a little hottie.


Kevin and Vicky are still making out in the bed


Vicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know.

VICKY
              (brief pause)
Let me know.

KEVIN
          Okay, don't stop.

She resumes. A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to
lose it.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
          Oh -- Now!

With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin frantically
searches for a receptacle. He grabs a nearby cup of beer.


Stifler kicks out of the room Vicky and Kevin


Vicky is buttoning up her shirt. Kevin tentatively sets down
the beer and buttons his pants. Suddenly the DOOR BURSTS
OPEN. Stifler is standing there. A coat hanger sticks out of
the doorknob.
 
STIFLER
          SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

KEVIN
          God dammit, Stifler!

STIFLER
          Check-out time!  Please vacate the
room.

VICKY
          Stifler, you're such a jerk.

She runs out, grabbing her clothes. Kevin runs after her.

KEVIN
          Vicky, wait!


Girl doesn't feel convinced making out with Stifler


She's about to take a sip.

STIFLER
              (gazing into her eyes)
          You're really beautiful.

Thrown off, she sets the beer down.

SOPHOMORE CHICK
Really?

STIFLER
          Uh huh.

She's totally enthralled. Nervous, she raises the beer again
to take a sip. Then Stifler moves in. Takes the beer from
her and sets it down. Starts kissing her. She breaks it off.


Jim is still disappointed he couldn't talk to Nadia


Jim and some OTHER GUYS are pounding shots of vodka.

JIM
          What the hell?  I should be able to
          talk to chicks. I'm articulate. I
          got a 720 on my SAT verbal.
              (starts listing off
               words)
          Copious. Verisimilitude.


Stifler starts vomiting


Stifler is on his knees, barfing in the toilet. Jim and a
few other guys rush in.

GUY #1
          Oh, gross.

JIM
          Jesus, what did you eat?

Stifler just keeps hurling. Kevin enters, holding the
remains of the tainted beer.

KEVIN
          Stifler, how's the man chowder?!

Stifler barfs even more violently.


Jim and Kevin see a picture of Stifler's Mom


Kevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM on
the wall. Very attractive, late 30's.

JIM
          Shit, I can't believe a fine woman
          like this produced a guy like
          Stifler.

TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this.

FRESHMAN GUY
          Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!

FRESHMAN GUY #2
          What the hell is that?

FRESHMAN GUY
          M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!


Sherman found a girl to pass the night


Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches. Sherman
pokes his head out.

SHERMAN
              (hushed, to guys)
          Don't you think you fellas could
          try a little tact?  I've got
          company. Know what I mean?

In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central Girl.
Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there, dumbstruck.


Vicky gets offended at Kevin


KEVIN
          Man, I just gotta get laid already!
          This blowjob thing is bullshit!

He stops. Vicky is there with Jessica. Staring at him. Vicky
quietly grabs her purse. Hurt. OTHER STUDENTS watch,
silently. Kevin doesn't know what to say.

VICKY
          Jessica, can you drive me home?

JESSICA
          Sure.

The guys watch as the girls head for the door.

KEVIN
          Vicky, wait.


Party's next morning 


The next morning. The party is long over. Plastic beer cups
and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed.
Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head. He
stumbles over a body. It's Kevin.

KEVIN
          Ow, what the hell?

JIM
          Sorry, I thought you were dead.


Sherman and the central girl get out of their room


We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs. It's the CENTRAL
GIRL. She wears a "Central" sweatshirt. Sherman follows
behind her. The guys watch in disbelief as Sherman and the
girl speak hushed, intimately.

SHERMAN
              (snippets of
               conversation)
          ...I'll never forget...thank you.

The Central Girl smiles. Notices the other guys watching.
Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.

CENTRAL GIRL
Bye.

She exits. The guys are dumbfounded. Jaws hang. Sherman
looks triumphant. Strides over to the guys.

JIM
          You did it.


Jim and his friends are depressed


Sherman exits. Silence. The guys look like they just lost
the World Series on errors. They slowly take seats, ruined.

KEVIN
          I put in months of quality time
          with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick
          for one night and scores?  This is
          just wrong.

OZ
          No shit, I'm never gonna get laid.
          How the hell am I gonna become this
          Mr. Sensitive Man?

JIM
          Jesus, we're all gonna go to
          college as virgins. They've
          probably got special dorms for
          people like us.


Kevin and his friends make a promise


KEVIN
Alright, I got an idea. But it
stays between us. Agreed?

They do.

          KEVIN (CONT'D)
Okay. It's really simple. We make
an agreement -- no wait, more than
an agreement.

JIM
Like a bet?
 
KEVIN
No, a pact. No money involved. This
is more important than any bet. Now
here's the deal: We all get laid
before we graduate.


The protagonists seal the pact


Kevin jumps up on a chair.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
          No longer will our penises remain
          flaccid and unused!  From now on,
          we fight for every man out there
          who isn't getting laid when he
          should be! This is our day!  This
          is our time! And, by God, we're not
          gonna let history condemn us to
          celibacy!  We will make a stand!
          We will succeed! We will get laid!

Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in
front of him. One by one, the guys pile their hands on top,
in between them -- it's a pact!  They break with a CHEER.
Woo-hoo!


Stifler insults his friends after the party


STIFLER
              (wandering down from
               upstairs)
          What the hell are you losers doing?

They all stop. Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his
mouth. A goatee of dried toothpaste.

FINCH
          If I might ask, when you brush your
          teeth, do you spit or swallow?

Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green and
heads back upstairs.


The protagonists set up the rules for their bet


The guys are finishing up breakfast. Hot dogs & eggs.

KEVIN
          Now, the sex -- it's got to be
          valid, consensual sex. No funny
          stuff. And no prostitutes, if you
          were thinking about that, Finch.

Finch gives a wistful "Who, me?"
 
KEVIN (CONT'D)
          So, I'm thinking prom is basically
          our last big chance.


The characters do a toast


KEVIN
          Alright then. It's official. Any
          questions?

There are none. Kevin raises his Pepsi.

KEVIN (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          To the next step.

The guys raise their drinks.

ALL
          To the next step.

They toast. And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING


Jim subscribes to a E-Date website


Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera attached
to his computer. The computer screen reads, "E- DATE:  We
Make Love Happen."  As Jim fiddles with the camera, a window
on the screen shows his real-time image. He clicks an
onscreen-button labeled "FREEZE IMAGE" -- the image freezes,
showing Jim with an awkward grimace. The screen reads,
"IMAGE SENT."


Jim's dad enters Jim's room


He opens the bedroom door. Jim's Dad is standing there.

JIM'S DAD
              (trying not to look
               inside)
          Can I come in?

JIM
          Yeah, sure.

JIM'S DAD
          You're not...busy?

JIM
          Dad, come in.

Jim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag. He
takes a seat on Jim's bed.


Jim's Dad gives Jim porn magazines


JIM'S DAD
          These are for you. From father to
son.

Jim looks at the bag. Uncomfortable. Hesitantly, he takes
it. Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of
PERFECT 10.

JIM
          Uh...dad...

Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.

JIM'S DAD
          Go ahead son, there's more.

Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag. Cringes. Pulls
out a PENTHOUSE.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
          Now, that one's a little more...a
          little more...graphic.


Jim's Dad makes sure his son knows where the clitoris is


JIM'S DAD
          This, son, is your more exotic
          dirty magazine.

JIM
          Dad!  I know!

JIM'S DAD
          Do you know about the clitoris?

JIM
              (through clenched teeth)
Yes dad.

JIM'S DAD
          Sometimes it can be pretty hard to
locate.

JIM
              (interrupting, hand up)
          Thank you, dad, I got it.

JIM'S DAD
          Okay, well that about covers it.


Jim's Dad finds out Jim's unraveled prophylactics


JIM'S DAD
          Now, let's put these somewhere
          where your mother won't find them.

Jim's Dad takes the stack of magazines. He goes to open
Jim's night table. Jim freaks.

JIM 
Wait!

But it's too late. Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the
unraveled prophylactics. He sours.

JIM'S DAD
              (beaten)
          I'll have to save this speech for
          another day. I'm too worn out.

Jim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants.


Vicki's still angry at Kevin


Kevin is trying to talk to Vicky.

KEVIN
          Did you get the flowers?
              (no response)
          What about the poem?

She doesn't care.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
          Vicky, please don't do this.

Vicky stares him right in the eye. Strong.

VICKY
          I'll think about it.

She slams her locker and walks off. Jessica is nearby. She's
overheard.


Jessica tells Kevin he has to give his girlfriend an orgasm


JESSICA
          Ah, you'll get her back soon
          enough. That's easy, she likes you.
          What you need to do is learn to
          press a girl's buttons. You gotta
          give her what she's never had.

KEVIN 
What?

JESSICA
          I'll give you a hint.
              (hot, orgasmic)
          "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"
              (flat)
          Comprende?

KEVIN
          You mean...and orgasm?

JESSICA
          You got it, stud.

KEVIN
          Well...I'm pretty sure I've --

JESSICA
              (interrupts
               authoritatively)
          No you haven't.


Jessica tells something strange to Kevin


JESSICA
          Do you love her?

Kevin squirms.

KEVIN
          I -- I don't know, you can't ask me
that.

JESSICA
          Well, if you want to get her in the
          sack, tell her you love her. That's
          how I was duped.

KEVIN
          I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.
          If I say it, I have to be sure I
          mean it.

JESSICA
          Well it's up to you. The Big L, or
          the Big O.


Oz finishes singing


JIM
          This is unexpected.

STIFLER
          What did you cocks do to him?
          Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this,
          he'll kick Oz off the team on
          principle alone.

The song finishes. Oz bounds up to the other guys.

OZ
          Hey guys, you came to watch me in
action?

JIM
          Yeah, I think you sounded pretty
good.

STIFLER
          I think you need your balls
reattached.

OZ
          Keep it down, dude.

STIFLER
          What the fuck are you doing here?

OZ
          This place is an untapped resource.
          Check it out, dude, these vocal
          jazz girls are hot.


Finch is sitting without doing nothing and his friends worry for him


Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree.
Kevin and Jim approach.

KEVIN
          This is your plan, Finch?

FINCH
          Yep.

He turns a page. Skims the articles. A beat.

KEVIN
          This. Right now.

FINCH
          Uh-huh.

JIM
          You're just gonna sit there and
          drink your coffee?


Finch says he's gotta go home pooping


KEVIN
          What are we gonna hear?

FINCH
          You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen
          minute round trip.

JIM
          Finch, don't you think it's about
          time you learned to take a dump at
          school?

FINCH
          When was the last time you looked
          at the facilities here?

KEVIN
          Fifteen minutes ago.

Finch shudders and walks away. Kevin and Jim stand there,
dumbfounded. An ENTHRALLED GIRL approaches.


Kevin asks his brother about female orgasm


Kevin's brother is on his cell phone. A SUSHI CHEF prepares
food behind the counter.

KEVIN'S BROTHER
Orgasm?

The Sushi Chef looks up. Kevin's Brother turns away.

KEVIN 
Yeah.

SUSHI CUSTOMER
              (to Kevin's Brother)
          What's good here?

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          Try the spicy tuna hand roll.

KEVIN
          What?!  How do I do that?


Kevin's brother tells Kevin he's ready for The Bible


KEVIN'S BROTHER
          Uh -- forget that. Look, is that
          all you're interested in?  Ways to
          get your girlfriend into bed?

KEVIN
          Well, no. I think...I guess it
          would be good to be able to return
          the favor. I mean, it would be nice
          to know she enjoys things as much
          as I do.

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          That's good, that's what I needed
          to hear. Now you qualify.

KEVIN
          Qualify for what?

KEVIN'S BROTHER
          You've just inherited The Bible.


Kevin's brother gives Kevin The Bible


Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
shelf. Pulls out a pocket knife. Flips up the bottom of the
shelf. Slides it out.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)
                    (CONT’D)
          You have to keep it a secret, and
          return it at the end of the year.
          So, now you know. Good luck.

There, a bit dusty, is an old book. Many extra pages of
notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking the
binding. The original title is now obscured -- over it,
someone has written "The Bible."
Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's
like that right now.


Jim arrives home


JIM 
(yells)
          Mom?!  I'm home!

No response. Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a fresh-
baked pie on the counter. Next to it is a note: "Jimmy -
Apple, your favorite. I'll be home late. Enjoy!  Love Mom."
Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma. Then stops...as a
quizzical look spreads across his face.


Jim's Dad is disappointed about what Jim did to the pie


Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at the
table. Jim stares into his lap, humiliated. Jim's dad is
crushed. You've never seen such disappointment... but he's
trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake.
In the middle of the table is the pie. It's decimated.
Mushed up, ruined...violated.

JIM'S DAD
              (fighting back tears)
          I guess...we'll just tell your
          mother...that we ate it all.


Kevin's studying The Bible


Late. Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the Bible.
If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this book,
we'd have a nation of geniuses. He's scrutinizing it.
Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher
cave paintings.


Oz gets offended 


OZ (no idea)
          Yeah. Right, uh-huh.
              (then, back into it)
          I feel like I've discovered this
          whole new side of me. Music is so
          expressive.

HEATHER
              (amused)
Okay. (then)
          I mean, I agree, but...aren't you
          supposed to be out, like, trying to
          decapitate someone with your
          lacrosse stick or something?

Oz "gets serious" at this.

OZ
          Oh sure. I know what people think.
          It's like, Oz, he's just this
          kickass lacrosse player -- I also
          play football, by the way -- But
          that's like...not all that I am.


Kevin and Vicky walk home together


Kevin is walking home with Vicky. He's a couple paces behind
her, almost tagging along.

KEVIN
          I was being selfish. And majorly
          insensitive. And I'm a total idiot.

VICKY
          I think "shithead" really says it.

KEVIN
          Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a
          complete and total shithead!

She cracks a little smile.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
          And I want to try to make it up to
you.

VICKY
          How?

Vicky stops walking. Looks at Kevin.


Vicky and Kevin make out again, this time Kevin has studied how to pleasure his girlfriend


Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING IN
ECSTASY.

VICKY (V.O.)
          Oh...ungghhhhh!

KEVIN (V.O.)
          Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs.


Vicky really appreciates how Kevin is pleasuring her


We see that Kevin is kneeling on the floor. Vicky's legs are
to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting the
bible, which is hidden beneath the bed. It's open to a page
titled "The Tongue Tornado."
Kevin resumes, out of frame. Vicky goes nuts.

                    VICKY
              (a little too loudly)
Oh, God!

Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow. She squeezes it over her
face, moaning into it.

                    VICKY (CONT'D)
          Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!


Vicky gets close to the orgasm


Vicky is about to explode. She pulls the pillow off her
face, gasping.


Jims' Dad decides to have a talk with Jim


Jim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad
looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the
hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's door.

JIM
          Hey, dad. Did you knock?

Jim's dad continues to study the picture. A beat. Then he
turns around, like he just realized the door was open.

JIM'S DAD
          Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol'
          family portrait, here. Yep. It's a
          good one.

Jim can only shrugs in response. He goes into the hall and
looks at the portrait. A beat.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
          Son, I wanted to talk to you about
          what I think you were trying to do
          the other day.

Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.


Jims' Dad tells Jim that he also masturbates


JIM'S DAD
          You do want a partner, don't you
          son?

JIM
              (through clenched teeth)
Yes.

JIM'S DAD
          That's great. Now remember, it's
          okay to play with yourself. Or, as
          I always called it --
              (elbows Jim)
          "Stroke the salami!"
              (chuckles)
          Ho-ho, Jim. There's nothing to be
          ashamed of. Hell, I'm fifty-two,
          and I still enjoy masturbating.
          Uncle Mort masturbates. We all
          masturbate.

Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble
back into his room. He SMACKS the doorframe. Keeps going,
slamming the door behind him. A beat.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
          Poor guy thought he was the only
          one.


Coach Marshall stops Oz after the game


After the game. Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the
sidelines. He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL snags
him --

COACH MARSHALL
          Good work, Ostreicher.

OZ
          Thanks coach.

COACH MARSHALL
          You're a killer, Ozzy!

OZ
              (trying to get away)
          -- Thanks, coach --

FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in mud.


Heather has something to say to Oz


Oz wipes the mud from his hands. A beat. Heather has
something to say that's not quite coming out.

HEATHER
          Um...Chris --

OZ
          You can call me Oz.

HEATHER
          Do I have to?

OZ
          You can call me Ostreicher.

HEATHER
          What's your middle name?

OZ 
Forget it.

HEATHER
          Come on!  I won't tell.

OZ
          Neither will I.


Oz reaches Stifler


OZ
          Alright, cool. I gotta hit the
          showers, but...I think this'll be
          really good.

HEATHER
          Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

They share a smile. Then Heather walks off towards her car.
Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse guys.

STIFLER
          My man Oz, working it with the
choir babes?

LACROSSE BUDDIES
              (cheering, slapping him)
          Yeah, go Oz! etc.

Oz laughs, embarrassed.


Heather sees Oz making fun of her


Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank-
Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance.

STIFLER (CONT'D)
          Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!

The other guys LAUGH. Oz joins in, laughing in spite of
himself. They all high-five.
And from the other side of the field, we see Heather peering
over at them. Hardly believing it as Oz joins in the
laughter.


The protagonists talk about Finch's reputation


JIM
          Hey, where's Finch?

KEVIN
          Went home to shit.

JIM
          I don't get it. How does a guy like
          that get this sudden reputation?

OZ
          What reputation?

KEVIN
          Observe.

He taps a passing RANDOM CUTE GIRL on the shoulder.

KEVIN (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          Excuse me. Do you know who Paul
Finch is?
 
RANDOM CUTE GIRL
          Of course!  Have you guys seen his
tattoo?


Jim meets Nadia again


JIM
              (a little aggravated)
          Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in front
of him. Jim says nothing. Stuck. Staring. Oz elbows him. Jim
gives a startled GRUNT.

NADIA
          You are very good in the world
          history class, yes?


Nadia asks Jim if she can go to his place to study


NADIA
          Perhaps you can help me with my
          studies?

The guys nod, "Yes!  Yes!"

JIM
          Okay...that would be cool sometime.
              (sees the guys
               gesticulating)
          How 'bout tomorrow?

NADIA
          Well, I do have ballet practice.
          Perhaps I can come by your house
          afterwards. I can change clothes at
          your place?

JIM
              (barely, overwhelmed)
          I suppose that would be okay.


Heather gets angry at Oz


She hastily walks towards the school.

OZ 
What?!

HEATHER
          Oh, please. I asked you because I
          thought you might actually be worth
          going with. But you are just a
          jock. No wait. You're a jerk.

OZ
          What?  No I'm not.

HEATHER
          I saw you making fun of me with
          your lacrosse buddies.

OZ
          I wasn't making fun of you.

HEATHER
          Give me a break, you're so full of
it.


Oz proposes to have a duet with Heather


CHOIR TEACHER
          A little, but I think it'll work
          better as a duet. With a tenor
          part.

OZ
              (interrupting)
I'll do it.

A beat as the Choir Teacher is impressed and Heather looks
indifferent.

OZ (CONT'D)
          I'll do it.

CHOIR TEACHER
          Okay then. The rest of you okay
with that?

The rest of the choir agrees, as Heather looks to Oz with
skepticism.


Heather is not happy that Oz wants to make the duet with her


The group starts packing up.

HEATHER
              (annoyed)
          Why are you doing this?

OZ
          Because I want to.

HEATHER
          Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way
          through this. You better practice.

She leaves.


Jim's friends want him to broadcast her naked friend with them


Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Stifler.

STIFLER
          Fuck me!  You're gonna have a naked
          Eastern-European chick in your
          house, and you're telling me you're
          not gonna take advantage of that?

JIM
          What am I gonna do, broadcast her
          over the internet?

OZ
          You can do that?

JIM
              (off their looks)
          Oh -- no way. I can't do that to
          her.

STIFLER
          Dammit, Jim, get some fucking
          balls. If you don't have the guts
          to photograph a naked chick in your
          room, how are you ever gonna sleep
          with one? Now all you gotta do is
          set up some sort of private link or
          whatever on the net, and tell me
          the address.


Jim sets up the webcam


Kevin and Finch sit in front of a computer. Kevin is
unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag.
We see an image of Jim's bedroom on the computer screen.
It's a little strobed, but easily watchable. Suddenly Jim's
face pops into frame. He's adjusting the camera.


Nadia arrives to Jim's room


Jim's dad enters with Nadia. She's in sweats and a leotard,
carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder. Jim's dad is
delighted, fidgety, almost giddy.

JIM'S DAD
          Son. This lady's here for you.

JIM
              (like it's no big deal)
          I know. Hey Nadia.

NADIA
          Hello James. Ready to study.


Jim gets out of his house in a hurry


Jim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs. Jim bolts through
the room.

JIM
          Be back in a sec!

He practically crashes through the door on his way out.

JIM'S MOM
          Jim?  Honey, where are you going?

She turns and looks at her husband. Both perplexed.


Jim arrives at Kevin's home in time to see Nadia getting naked


Kevin and Finch are watching the computer screen.

KEVIN
          Want a beer?

Finch simply waves off the question. He's glued to the
screen.
Jim bursts into the room, breathless.

JIM
          Did I miss anything?!

KEVIN
          Just in time.

Jim grabs a seat by the computer. All three guys watch,
transfixed. Nadia is slipping out of her leotard.


Stifler's brother enjoys the show


Stifler and his brother are awestruck.

STIFLER'S BROTHER
          This is like the coolest thing I've
          ever seen.


Nadia finds out Jim's porn magazines and enjoys them


Nadia opens the night table. Stops. Jim flushes. Nadia delicately reaches into the night table as Jim crumbles.
JIM (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          Oh no no no.

She pulls out the stack of porno magazines.

KEVIN
          Nice collection there, Jim.

Nadia takes a PENTHOUSE. Starts thumbing through it. She
sits on Jim's bed. Lingering on some pages. Getting aroused.

JIM
          Dear God -- she's -- she's -- she's
--

Welcome to every man's fantasy. Nadia's hand wanders into
her panties.

JIM (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          Gentlemen, I'd like to make an
          announcement. There is a gorgeous
          woman masturbating on my bed.

The guys watch, completely blown away. Nadia's lost herself.


Jim sent by mistake the email containing the link of his webcam to all highschool


KEVIN
          Come on, Jim. Where are you?

The PHONE RINGS. Kevin answers.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
              (into phone)
          Hello?  Hey Sherman...what?!  How
          did you know?

Sherman sits in front of a computer.

SHERMAN
              (into phone)
          Jim must've addressed that E-mail
          wrong. It went out to every mailbox
          in the East High directory. God,
          how juvenile.


Jim prays God before entering his room


Jim still waits outside his bedroom door. Takes a deep
breath. Looks upwards to the sky.

JIM
          Please, God. Let this be it.


Jim catches Nadia by surprise while she's masturbating


Jim stands there, bewildered. Nadia hasn't noticed him, eyes
closed, still pleasuring herself. Jim stands there,
watching, faltering. Gathers his courage. Finally, he rolls
his eyes and says --

JIM
          Looks like you could use an extra
          hand.

Nadia's eyes flash open.

NADIA
              (chastising)
          James!  You have come in here on
          purpose?!

JIM
          Well...uh...

NADIA
          Shame on you!

JIM
          Uh...yeah...sorry.

NADIA
          Well. You have seen me. Now it is
          my turn to see you. Strip.


Nadia puts on some music


Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio. Turns it on. We hear
COUNTRY MUSIC. She flips the dial, and we hear A FEW
STATIONS FLIP BY. Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG.

NADIA
          Perfect.

She turns to Jim.

JIM 
Uh...

NADIA
          Move with the music.

JIM
          Um...okay...


Jim starts dancing


NADIA
          No, no, you must put your whole
body into it.

JIM
          Nadia, I can't --

NADIA
          Can't what?  Do you not want to be
          with me?  I wish to be entertained,
          James.

Jim nods eagerly. Concentrates on the music...as we see the
shirt slide off the camera. Jim starts writhing to the beat.
Like a hyperactive chicken.


Some girls see Jim's dancing


A GROUP OF GIRLS watches in amusement.

GIRL IN BEDROOM
          Work it, baby!

The LAUGH and dance mockingly along with Jim.


Nadia tells Jim to come to her in the bed


NADIA
          Now!  Hames, come to me.

JIM 
Oh yeah!

Jim dances over to her. She pulls him onto the bed. Kisses
his neck. Takes his hand. Places it on her thigh.

NADIA
          Be gentle.

Jim GULPS.


Jim cums too early


Jim's hand wanders up Nadia's leg. She does the same to him.
Blows in his ear. Her hand is about to enter his shorts.
And Jim is done. Bang. That's it.
He looks down at himself in terror. Nadia sees. Backs away.

NADIA 
Jim...

JIM 
Oh no.


Nadia is about to leave


Nadia is getting dressed.

NADIA
          You are done, James. Perhaps I
          should be going now.

                    JIM
          No, no, I'm not done!  I've got
          reserves!  Nadia, please please
          please. I'm begging you.

She sees the desperation in his eyes. Thinks about it.
Smiles.

NADIA
          I do like your dirty magazines.


Nadia and Jim starts over again


NADIA
          Yes...James, it is knowing that
          these beautiful women arouse you
          that arouses me...

JIM
          Oh yes. Very arousing women. They
          arouse me very much. But not as
          arousing as you.

She goes for this line. Gives in.

NADIA
          Oh Jim...

She grabs him. Starts caressing his body.


Nadia starts taking off her pants


Groping. They're tangled in each other. Nadia backs off for
a moment. Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in the sides
of her panties. Starts sliding them down.

NADIA
          So, "shaved" is the expression?

CLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out. Yep, it is, and she is.

JIM
              (mutters)
          Holy shit.


Nadia comes close to Jim, but he cums again too early


Jim is stuck. Staring at Nadia. She moves towards him. Nadia
is inches from his face.

NADIA
          Touch me Jim...here.

Jim is trembling, straining with himself. A shudder runs
through him.
And it's over, again.


Jim becomes famous after the strip show on webcam


Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed. A COUPLE
GIRLS pass by him, giggling. He trudges along...noticing a
CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he passes by...and Stoner
#1 giving him a peace sign...and the Computer Nerd staring
at him like a celebrity...... Jim's pace slows. He hears a
SNICKER behind him...he slows even more, taking very careful
steps...as he sees a GIRL doing a really strange dance --
and his eyes pop out as he sees that, yes, it's his dance.
He stops. ALMOST EVERYONE is staring at him. Jim pulls his
coat up over his face and hurries off into the school, like
a fugitive avoiding the media. People APPLAUD and LAUGH.


Jim and his friends meet and talk about the webcam show with Nadia


Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim. Here and there, people still
give Jim funny looks.

KEVIN
          Hey, minuteman.

JIM
          Shut up. You're supposed to be
supportive.

OZ
          You've still got a chance with
          Nadia, right?

JIM
          No. Her sponsors here saw the thing
          on the net. I don't think they
          liked it.

KEVIN
          How do you know that?

JIM
          She's already on a plane back home.


Michelle talks to Jim about the band camp


MICHELLE
          And so, one time?  I was at band
          camp? And we weren't supposed to
          have pillow fights?  But we had a
          pillow fight! And it was so much
          fun!

Jim couldn't care.

MICHELLE (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
          And one time, we all lost our
          music? And we were supposed to play
          this song?  But we didn't know it.
          So we just made it up!  And we kept
          playing and playing but the
          conductor didn't know what we were
          doing and it was so funny!

Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk.


Jim asks Michelle if she wants to go with him to the prom


MICHELLE
          I thought so. Because, one time?  I
was at this --

JIM
              (interrupting)
          What was your name again?

MICHELLE
          Michelle.

JIM
          Okay. Michelle, do you want to be
          my date for the prom?

MICHELLE
          Really?  You seriously want to go
with me?

JIM
              (so forced)
          Yes. Seriously.

MICHELLE
          Are we going to Steve Stifler's
          party afterwards?  That would be so
          cool.

JIM
          Whatever you want.


Vicky tells Kevin she loves him


KEVIN
              (pause)
          You want to do it?

VICKY 
Yes --

She takes his hand. Readies herself, and declares.

VICKY (CONT'D)
          I love you.

Kevin falters. This is definitely not what he was expecting.
He's caught. Trying to formulate a response.


Kevin is not ready to have a relationship with Vicky


KEVIN
          I didn't say that. I mean, love,
          it's like a term that gets thrown
          around. People say things, they get
          married, have kids, and then what?
          It's like they call it off, going
          "I was wrong."

A beat. Vicky seems to know where he's coming from.

VICKY
          Kevin...you're not your dad. The
          two of us, we're not your parents.

KEVIN
          I know, Vick. I'm just not ready
yet, okay?

VICKY 
Okay.
